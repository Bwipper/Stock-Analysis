# The Analysis of Stocks from 2018
### Creating a macro in VBA to analyze stocks

## Overview of Project
  ### Purpose and Backround
    This project had us working in Excel and VBA to create a macro that our client can utilize to analyze stocks. This will allow them to make informed decisions about where to invest in the future. 

## Anaylsis and Challenges 
  ### Overview of Anaylsis 
    We used stock data from 2017 and 2018 to make sure our macro was correctly able to analyze the stocks trends of the past. This would confirm that we could take the macro and apply it to future stock data and inform users where they should and shouldnt be investing their money. 
    
  ### Challenges involved
    I am very new to the world of creating macros and writing code so this was quite a challenge for me. Thankfully the modules are pretty precise in their instructions so I could refer back to them and the previous work we did when I ran into issues. I also have a friend who works in SQL at a large bank who was in town and I was able to get some of her help on this project as well. She had never used VBA before but I guess if you learn one coding language the others are pretty similar. Ultimatly I think I just need to put the hours in and keep trying to learn this code and the languages going forward. I think with enough time I will get the hang of it and become profecient. I think the main issue is that I am not really thinking "in code", and thus I tend to overanalyze what Im doing ang get stuck.
